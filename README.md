# DOTA-2-Project

## Goal
The primary focus of this project is to explore the data from the [Dota 2 API](https://www.opendota.com/) and work on machine learning techniques with said data. Because of the large variety and amount of data available through the API, my first task will be to look at an explore the picks and bans of a single professional team and see what information can be gained.
